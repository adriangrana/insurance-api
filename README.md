# Insurance API

## Description

This project is a Web API that manages insurance policies and company clients. It is built using the FastAPI framework and follows the hexagonal architecture pattern.

## Endpoints

- `GET /users/{user_id}`: Get user data filtered by user id (accessible by users with role "users" and "admin").
- `GET /users/name/{user_name}`: Get user data filtered by user name (accessible by users with role "users" and "admin").
- `GET /policies/user/{user_name}`: Get the list of policies linked to a user name (accessible by users with role "admin").
- `GET /users/policy/{policy_id}`: Get the user linked to a policy number (accessible by users with role "admin").

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd insurance_api
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the application:
    ```sh
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```

5. Access the API documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.
